# According to the EditorConfig specification, the [docs/internal/**.md]
# section should inherit `indent_size = 2` from the [docs/**.md] section,
# but it only inherits `indent_size = 4` from the [*.md] section.

# I think it's not feasible to fix this, but it's good to have a test that
# documents this behavior.
